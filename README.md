# MaxGear-CV
MaxGear is a game based on old NES and SNES classics like Top Gear and Turbo Racing, but with an added twist of using computer vision for driving.
Choose between two maps with classic soundtracks!
Drive through courses and compete to see who takes the lowest times to complete each track!

# Controls
Use the arrow keys to turn sideways and accelerate your car!
Or you can accelerate with the space bar / Left mouse-click and turn the car with your head, by using the face detection screen, powered by the openCV open-source library!
Make sure to keep your head vertical while using it!
