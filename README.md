# MaxGear-CV
MaxGear is a game based on old NES and SNES classics like Top Gear and Turbo Racing, but with an added twist of using computer vision for driving.

It uses the OpenCV open-source library to render a window in which the player can control the turning of the car, based on face detection on each side of the screen, using the haarcascades algorithm.

MaxGear also uses the olcPixelGameEngine and olcSoundWaveEngine open-source libraries by javidx9 to run and render while playing these classic soundtracks!

My extended thanks to javidx9 and the OneLoneCoder community for the olcPixelGameEngine and olcSoundWaveEngine libraries, as well as all the help and advice given.

# Incentive
This Game was made as the final project for a class that focuses on teaching students about Objected Oriented Programming, at the Federal University of Paraíba

Project Group: José Ricardo Rodrigues, Ana Carolina Moura e Ulderico Neto.

Taught by Derzu Omaia and Marcelo Iury de Oliveira.

# Controls
Use the arrow keys to turn sideways and accelerate your car!

Or you can accelerate with the space bar / Left mouse-click and turn the car with your head using the face detection screen, powered by openCV!

Make sure to keep your head vertical while using face detection!
